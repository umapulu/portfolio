      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p class="bio">
        Hi! I’m <strong>Uma (Deepa) Pulugurtha</strong> — a senior at Cornell University studying
        Computer Science with a Mathematics minor. I’m passionate about algorithms, optimization,
        and building systems that are both elegant and practical.
      </p>

      <p class="bio">
        My academic interests lie in algorithm design, data structures, and computational theory,
        but I also enjoy applying these ideas in software engineering and product-focused projects.
        I’ve built systems for motion planning, caching, and web applications — experiences that
        have strengthened my appreciation for efficient, intuitive design.
      </p>

      <p class="bio">
        Beyond academics, I’m a <strong>teaching and community-focused learner</strong>. I serve on
        the <strong>Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC)</strong> Technical Committee, where I help
        mentor members and contribute to the WICC website. I’ve also tutored for several years,
        sharing my love for learning and helping others grow in computer science.
      </p>

      <p class="bio">
        Outside of tech, I teach rock climbing, explore new coffee shops, and enjoy games like
        Mario Kart, Spikeball, and Minecraft. I’m always curious about how systems — whether human,
        physical, or computational — interact and evolve.
