      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p class="bio">
        Hi! My name is <strong>Uma (Deepa) Pulugurtha</strong>. a senior at Cornell University studying
        Computer Science with an Applied Mathematics minor. I’m passionate about algorithms, optimization,
        and building systems that are both elegant and practical.
      </p>

      <p class="bio">
        My academic interests lie in algorithm design, data structures, and computational theory,
        but I also enjoy applying these ideas in software engineering and product-focused projects.
        I’ve built all kinds of applications, and each of these experiences have strengthened
        my appreciation for efficient, intuitive design.
      </p>

      <p class="bio">
        When I'm not studying or building apps, I'm a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms (CS 4820), serve on Women
        in Computing at Cornell (WICC) Technical Committee, and teach Basic Rock Climbing (PE 1640)!
      </p>

      <p class="bio">
        Outside of school, I love to explore new coffee shops and enjoy games like
        Mario Kart, Spikeball, and Minecraft. I’m always curious about how systems (human or computer)
        are made and how this influences how they interact with each other.
